This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

Let's start

Import library

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # Data visualization
library(readr) # CSV file I/O, e.g. the read_csv function

library(rpart) #decision tree
library(rattle)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)

```

```{r}
library(randomForest)
```


Import data

```{r}
#Import the training set: train
train_url <- "http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/Kaggle/train.csv"
train <- read.csv(train_url)

#Import the testing set: test
test_url <- "http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/Kaggle/test.csv"
test <- read.csv(test_url)

#visualize data sets
str(train)
str(test)
```

Analayze data

Male vs Female
```{r}
# Survival rates in absolute numbers
table(train$Survived)

# Survival rates in proportions
prop.table(table(train$Survived))
  
# Two-way comparison: Sex and Survived
table(train$Sex, train$Survived)

# Two-way comparison: row-wise proportions
prop.table(table(train$Sex, train$Survived),1)
```

```{r}
# Create the column child, and indicate whether child or no child
train$Child <- NA
train$Child[train$Age < 18] <- 1
train$Child[train$Age >= 18] <- 0

# Two-way comparison
prop.table(table(train$Child, train$Survived),1)
```

First prediction

```{r}
# Copy of test
test_one <- test

# Initialize a Survived column to 0
test_one$Survived <- 0

# Set Survived to 1 if Sex equals "female"
test_one$Survived[test_one$Sex == 'female'] <- 1


```

Second prediction: tree

```{r}
my_tree_two <- rpart(Survived ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked, data = train, method = "class")

# Visualize the decision tree using plot() and text()
plot(my_tree_two)
text(my_tree_two)

# Time to plot your fancy tree
fancyRpartPlot(my_tree_two)

#prediction
my_prediction <- predict(my_tree_two, newdata = test, type = "class")

# Finish the data.frame() call
my_solution <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = my_prediction)

# Use nrow() on my_solution
nrow(my_solution)

# Finish the write.csv() call
write.csv(my_solution, file = "my_solution.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

  Third prediction:
  
  
  
```{r}
# Change this command
my_tree_three <- rpart(Survived ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked,
                     data = train, method = "class", control = rpart.control(minsplit = 50, cp = 0))

# Visualize my_tree_three
fancyRpartPlot(my_tree_three)
```


Prediction: Random Forest

```{r}
str(train)
str(test)
```

```{r}
# Passenger on row 62 and 830 do not have a value for embarkment.
# Since many passengers embarked at Southampton, we give them the value S.
train$Embarked[c(62, 830)] <- "S"

# Factorize embarkment codes.
train$Embarked <- factor(train$Embarked)

# Passenger on row 1044 has an NA Fare value. Let's replace it with the median fare value.
train$Fare[891] <- median(train$Fare, na.rm = TRUE)

# How to fill in missing Age values?
# We make a prediction of a passengers Age using the other variables and a decision tree model.
# This time you give method = "anova" since you are predicting a continuous variable.
library(rpart)
predicted_age <- rpart(Age ~ Pclass + Sex + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked,
                       data = train[!is.na(train$Age),], method = "anova")
train$Age[is.na(train$Age)] <- predict(predicted_age, train[is.na(train$Age),])
```



```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(111)

# Apply the Random Forest Algorithm
my_forest <- randomForest(as.factor(Survived) ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked, data = train,importance=TRUE, ntree=1000)

# Make your prediction using the test set
my_prediction <- predict(my_forest, test)

# Create a data frame with two columns: PassengerId & Survived. Survived contains your predictions
my_solution <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = my_prediction)

# Write your solution away to a csv file with the name my_solution.csv
write.csv(my_solution, file = "my_solution_random.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
